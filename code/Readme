1998 to 2001 or so I was working at Left Field Productions in Westlake Village,
California doing color gameboy programming. I was co-developer on:

Kobe Bryant 3 on 3
Beauty And The Beast: A Boardgame Adventure

I was sole developer on:
Little Mermaid II Pinball Frenzy
Thrillride Pinball

There was some interest in archiving source and data for these ancient gaming
machines so I dug it out and got it all to build on a modern recent linux
OS (I use ubuntu 18.04 LTS).

You'd just do

make

in this directory and hopefully everything will build.
The emulator I wrote is in the mgb/ directory and it uses SDL 1.x. If you do

make play

in this directory after a successful build it should launch the emulator with
the merm.gb image.


The keyboard keys are tuned for the pinball game.

Left + Right shift are flippers
A is start
Arrow keys do something
Z does something (push the table right)
/ does something (push the table left)
space does something (push the table up)

The emulator was used for development, it's much more convenient than an
actual color gameboy.



********* LITTLE MERMAID II PINBALL FRENZY *********

There was a USA version that included 5 languages, and a Japanese version
that had just english and japanese languages. The US version had a rumble pack
but didn't support the gameboy printer. The Japanese version had no
rumble pack but it did support the gameboy printer.

The source copy I have is closer to the Japanese version and the build
result merm.gb doesn't byte for byte match the released USA version, which
is readily available on rom download sites. I spent some time trying to
get the output to match but it's hopeless. I should have archived the code
associated with the final USA release so I could always rebuild it... but
oh well.

The gameplay is the same. Some of the artwork changed between the two versions
and the font data changed and there is the rumble/printer difference already
mentioned.
